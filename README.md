# Wetzoek
Repository for [Wetzoek](www.wetzoek.nl), a project to make Dutch law more accessible. This project has been made possible thanks to the [SIDN Fonds](https://www.sidnfonds.nl/). It has been carried out primarily by Felix van Litsenburg, with assistance from [Branden Chan] (https://github.com/brandenchan) and [Elena Stein] (https://github.com/elenche95) and Julia van Litsenburg.

We employ [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/intro) for the backend. Several articles explaining some of the steps taken can be found on Felix van Litsenburg's [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@fvanlitsenburg/).

## Back-end and front-end
Most of the information stored in this repository concerns Wetzoek's back-end. The development of the frontend was done by [Berlin Bytes](https://berlin-byt.es/en/) and paid for by Felix van Litsenburg privately, hence may not be released publicly.
